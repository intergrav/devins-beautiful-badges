# For now, please use the badge template.

> Update Jun 16 2024: I plan on doing a project restructure (v4) at some point to clean up a lot of stuff and make it easier to maintain this project.

> Update Nov 3 2024: Official NeoForge vectors are now out. You can check them out in the pull request.

If you need any new badges that are not already in the official repository, please create your own using this [badge template](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/v3/other/devinsbadges-template.fig). You can open it in Figma, which is a web-based design tool that Devin's Badges is made with. Why? I currently do not have enough motivation or time to work on this project. I probably wont close any issues for the time being, so that is why it is *highly* recommended to make your own. It's very easy to use the template, and it contains some instructions for new users.

Now, this doesn't mean the current files in the project are being removed or anything - they'll stay of course, I likely just wont be adding any new ones **or accepting any PRs for now.**

Thank you for understanding.

# üèÖ About

This is Devin's Badges! A project I work on in my spare time that contains cool badges for you to use in your projects.

I aim to be as consistent as possible with these. I also try to make these look great on most modern sites.

## üì∞ Using in your project

Want to add these badges to your page? Head over to the [badge reference](https://intergrav.github.io/devins-badges-docs/badges/) to find the badges most fitting for your use, and how to use them. You can then copy the HTML code, which I recommend for best customizability, or the Markdown code for your chosen badge, and paste that into your file.

## ‚ûï Adding more badges

Want to add your own badge ideas to the project? Feel free to open up an issue and I'll make one!

You can make badges for your own personal use aswell if I am not available; it's pretty easy to make the badges as long as you know a bit of Figma.

## ‚ùó Disclaimer

This is currently a work in progress, I only have a few badges for a few services right now. However, I am planning to have a lot more badges eventually.
